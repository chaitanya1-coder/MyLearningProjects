<h2>19 Year Boy Went On a solo trip... </h2>
<h4>By CHAITANYA CHAWLA</h4>
<p class="left">A 19 year old boy travelled all alone to another part of country. Why?
I wanted to have some fun, a different culture experience, a new exposure, a mist of adventure, wanted to interact with strangers and so on. So, inspired by a movie character (Kabir, YJHD), I decided to go on a solo trip. Since I am a student that’s why I planned a budget trip. I was living in Delhi from years and it was in my bucket list to visit down south Kanyakumari (south most point of India). So bag was packed like a traveller and my journey started with an early morning flight from Delhi to Trivandrum (nearest airport to Kanyakumari). As it was a budget trip so after reaching airport, I decided to stay in Dormitory (Hostel) instead of personal room. Googling few dormitory I found the right one which was near Shangumukham beach. After taking an auto from Trivandrum airport which shook my pocket. Imagine you have a goal to have a budget trip and right after you enter the city and an auto ride spills water to your dreams. Instead of taking it as a setback, I took it as a challenge to achieve my goal of budget trip. After reaching my Dormitory I asked my dormitory manager about the routes and how do local travels, basically how to travel cheaply. The manager gave me the idea to travel by bus while commuting in the city. I took a bus went for some site seeing.</p>
<p id="bottom">The first one was seeing very famous Padmanabhaswamy Temple which is world’s richest temple. This temple contains treasure of Trivancore kingdom and jewels of royal family. Since temple is closed in the afternoon so I decided to come back again in the evening and as I was feeling hungry so I had a delicious brunch (masala Dosa, remembering it still puts water in my mouth). Then I took a local bus to Napier museum which has some of the oldest sculptures and some marvellous artwork. Visiting this museum increased my General knowledge. Besides Napier museum I also visited zoo, which has a perfect combination of flora and fauna. I had a local ice-cream from there which was really fresh.After that I came back to Padmanabhaswamy Temple where I came to know that boys can’t wear anything on top and in the bottom only “Dhoti”. As I am belonging from a modern family living in an urban city I was confused whether to experience this primitive culture and should visit temple like a priest or not, but rather I took it as an one time opportunity and decided to go inside. Later I realised that it’s a must visit place. Long queues , Too much crowd, waiting for an hour everything was worthy at the end.
After that remarkable evening temple visit I had some light snack and a meal for dinner from the market area of east fort.Headed back to the dorm from local bus. Luckily I was alone in the dorm and I slept soundly.

<h2>Heading to Kanyakumari</h2>
<p class="left">The next morning I woke up and straight away went to shankughanam beach. I had a slow morning walk on the sea shore and saw a mesmerising view.The sound of those waves were quite peaceful and air was quite refreshing. After that I came back to the dorm got ready did the checkout around noon. Boom!!, I was ready to go to Kanyakumari. I headed back to the east fort did some window shopping. In brunch I had one the best sambhar rice of my life on banana leaves from hotel anpurana with hands instead of spoon. It was the best food experience of my whole trip. Then, I took a bus for Kanyakumari. The view from the bus is a must watch view with full of mountain valleys and Hills .I reached Kanyakumari in the evening had a really quick search for the budget hotel. After getting rejection from a lot of hotel ( because I was staying alone), I finally got the right hotel. Without wasting a minute I straight away went to see sunset. The view was breathtaking. Then I again did some window shopping at Kanyakumari local market had my dinner and came back to the hotel and slept. My next morning began with a watch of sunrise from sea. Then I got ready, had some delicious idly and went for the sightseeing. Firstly I went to the very famous Kanyakumari Devi Temple. Then I went to kamraj, Gandhi memorial. I also went to aqua world which is a must vist place if you are a fish lover. Then I went to take a ferry to Vivekananda rock memorial ( India‘s southern most tip) and found out that ferry is closed due to high tide. It was quite pity actually.</p> 
<p>After that I went to the pier which is like a long human made bridge on the ocean. Analogy is that pier is like “Ram Setu”. There, I had a chit chat with some foreigners and Travellers. That was the moment I realised that talking to strangers on a solo trip is an important part of exploring. The lady from Germany shared her experience of traveling India quoting to her words she said “ I am in love with India” Being Indian this was a proud moment for me. There I also met a solo traveler who started his Kanyakumari to Kashmir trip from that day only. He was from Kerala and was on a long holiday and was traveling whole India. His words were “Life is meant to be travel and enjoy “ . I only know his name <em>Mithun Lal</em> and regret not taking his contact details. After that I realised that today isn’t the day for going to Vivekananda Rock because of the bad weather (high tide). I decided to go to vattakotai fort. I took an auto ( because I didn’t knew about the local bus in Kanyakumari) which again shocked my pockets. Can you imagine Rs 150 for 5 km. I reached to vattakotai fort. The view from the top of the roof was mesmerising. There I found two boys traveling from Gujarat. We became very good friends. Then we three went to an isolated beach which was beside vattakotai fort. I had a dip in the sea on that beach which was surely a life long one time experience. We headed back to city by a local bus. After that We had some typical local South Indian Dosa from a very local restaurant. Then, We had some philosophical discussion about life on a bench near the sea shore and let the sound of waves making an impact on our mind. After that we went to our respected hotels.</p>
